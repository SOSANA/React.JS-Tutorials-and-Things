/*
 * WHY REACT
 *  - UI code is readable and maintainable
 *  - Creating UI components allows for modularity and code reusability
 *  - React can be rendered on both client & server side
 *  - It uses a concept called Virtual DOM that selectively renders subtrees of nodes upon state changes.
 * 
 * ReactJS Virtual DOM
 *  - React runs a diffing algorithm which at exactly has changed
 *  - Reconcilition where it updates the document object model with the results of diff
 *  - in other words it will only change the child attributes we updated while not affecting the parent 
 *    or changing the other child elements
 *
