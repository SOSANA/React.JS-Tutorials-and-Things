          <p class="e-body1 line-height-15 e-text-blue-grey-400 e-padding-bottom-15">In the word of the mighty Google, material design is a visual language for our users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science. Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.

          <p class="e-body1 line-height-15 e-text-blue-grey-400 e-padding-bottom-15">It’s not always natural what feels to be natural. We call natural interactions those that are total automatisms and require no extra thinking on our part. And for this to happen we need to have meaning, intuitiveness and intention. We use crisp and large typography, big imagery and perfect color balances to immerse the user in his experience. </p>
          <p class="e-body1 line-height-15 e-text-blue-grey-400 e-padding-bottom-15">All this combined provide a user interaction that “feels natural”.</p>

          <p class="e-body1 line-height-15 e-text-blue-grey-400 e-padding-bottom-15">No interface should start movement by itself. Motion is only within the grasp of the user and he holds the absolute authority of what happens and when. And when the motion starts, it transforms the whole design - but it all takes place in a single environment that gives the user a sense of familiarity, coherence and trust. </p>
          <p class="e-body1 line-height-15 e-text-blue-grey-400 e-padding-bottom-15">Movement has purpose and that purpose is to provide seamless interaction and continuity, down to its essence. </p>
