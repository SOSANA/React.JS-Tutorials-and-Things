/**
 * Testing using Mocha:
 *  - always all our tests will follow the same syntax for
 *    'describe', 'it', and 'expect'
 *  - 'describe' and 'it' take a first argument of string and second argument of a function
 *    and inside this function is our specs
 *
 * Three main core constructs for testing:
 *  - describe:
 *    - groups together similar tests
 *    - conveys to other developers that a certain number of tests
 *      are related in fashion
 *  - it:
 *    - used to test a single attribute of a target.
 *    - 'it' blocks try to make an assertion about a very particular
 *      fact about the testing subject
 *  - expect:
 *    - used to make an 'assertion' about a target
 *    - Used for a very particular attribute for our target
