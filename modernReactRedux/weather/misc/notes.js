/**
 * creating a container:
 *  - is a react component that has direct connection to the state managed by redux
 *  - forms the bridge between react and redux, in our mockup its part of that app
 *  	that joins these two libraries
 *  - we inject data/state into a container
 *  - also called smart component
 *  - our most parent component should be our container
 *  - the react-redux module is the glue between react and redux
 *
 * form tags:
 *  - using form vs div we get out of the box handlers for click and enter without having
 *  	to create handlers for each.
 *  - Use a form tag for any type of user input
