/*
 * DOM event listeners that can be implemented in a component
 * 
 * Special Non-DOM Att
 *  - key
 *    - this is optional
 *    - this is a unique identifier
 *    - when ever your component shuffles around during render it might be destroyed and 
 *      recreated do to the diff algorithm. Assigning it a key that persist makes sure
 *      the component stays.
 *  - ref
 *    - This special property allows you to refer to the corresponding backing instance 
 *        of anything returned from render(). It is always guaranteed to be the proper instance, 
 *        at any point in time.
 *    - this identifies a particular node and call functions on that node example:
 *        <input ref="myInput" />
 *        this.refs.myInput
 *        React.findDOMNode(this.refs.myInput).
 *    - example shown in /dom folder
 *    - more info @ https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html
 *  - dangerously SetInnerHTML
 *    - this provides the ability insert raw html and mainly for incorporating DOM string 
 *      manipulation librares
 * 
 * These events are not included in reactjs ex; "resize" event handlers. This implementation is
 * also good for integration with other libraries such as jquery.
