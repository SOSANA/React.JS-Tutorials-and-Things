// Tutorial 12 - final-words.js

// There is actually more to Redux and react-redux than what we showed you with this tutorial. For example,
// concerning Redux, you may be interested in bindActionCreators (to produce a hash of action creators
// already bound to dispatch - http://rackt.org/redux/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html).

// We hope we've given you the keys to better understand Flux and to see more clearly
// how Flux implementations differ from one another--especially how Redux stands out ;).

// Where to go from here?

// The official Redux documentation is really awesome and exhaustive so you should not hesitate to
// refer to it from now on: http://rackt.org/redux/index.html

// Have fun with React and Redux!
